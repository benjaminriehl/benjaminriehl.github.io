Hi there! I'm Ben, currently a Grade 11 High School student, located in the "Middle of Nowhere, MB".

In my down time, I enjoy my hobbies & exercising my talents, which range from Amateur Radio to Computers & Electronics.
I started this website as a blog or a dumping ground to post cool stuff I've worked on over the past couple years.

The theme I'm using for this entire site is based off of one of the default Jekyll themes called "Minima", the main reason I chose it, was it looked clean & offers alot of flexibility when it comes to a simple webpage / blog.

P.S. If you're hiring or know of someone who is, please take a look at my [https://riehl.me/files/BenRiehlResume.pdf](resume!) (I really need to find some employment!)
