Howdy stranger!

I'm Benjamin Riehl, or you can call me Ben. I'm a freshly graduated high school student who will be attending university for computer engineering in Montreal come this fall (2022). 

I got a lot of stuff on the go at the moment, mainly hobbies and community service related activites. I'm a licensed and active radio amateur (or if you fancy HAM radio) in both Canada and the United States, and I love doing Parks On The Air & doing various portable activities. I'm also a Transport Canada certified RPAS Flight Reviewer and a holder of the RPAS Advanced certificate. On the other side I'm also working towards finishing my Transport Canada Private Pilot's License to take with me to university.

You can find more of my schenanigans on this website as well, and also on my various other related sites. 

Thanks for stopping by! 
~ Ben
